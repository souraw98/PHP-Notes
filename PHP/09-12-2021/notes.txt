Basic story:-
php is a our technology, and php is a server side language.

Why not php will execute on the browser?
https://www.facebook.com/  :   resource
file:///D:/APP-2021/PHP/home.html   :   resourse

1. According to client server model anything which is loaded by client(browser) will be called as resourse.
2. 

Common terms used in Web Tech:-
1. Human (End User)
2. God  (Server)
3. Prayers  (Request)
4. Blessings  (Response)


How End User is going to make a request:-
End user will make a request using URL

End User Will use Browser as a Interface(Platform) to make a Request by using URL.

How Many Types of request are there:-
There can be only 2 types of requests
	1. Synchronous Request :- PHP, Python, .Net, JSP,..... etc
	2. Asynchronous Request :- Ajax, Node.js


Synchronous Request:- A request in which one event depends on other request to happen, 
such type of request is called as synchronous request. And these requests are blocking in nature

For Example:- 
1. JS ----> window.alert();
2. PHP ----> form submit

Asynchronous Request:- A request in which one event does not depend upon other event, such type of request is called as a 
asynchoronous request, These request are non-blocking in nature.

1. Node.js  ---> window.alert();
	R1 -------> wait
	R2 -------> Process ---> Success
	R3 -------> wait
	R4 -------> Process --->Success
	
2. PHP
	R1 -------> wait ---> success
	R2 -------> wait ---> process ---> success
	R3 -------> wait ---> process ---> success
	R4 -------> wait ---> process
	




Getting Started with LARAGON :-
1. While opening laragon screen you will called as laragon control panel.

1. menu :-  All the importaant settings, logs, errors, initialisation, configurations, related to, apache, mysql, php, will
be listed here.

Important files:
1.  .ini => initialisation file
			it will contain all the important services, assets, resources,
			permission, utilities, required by any program during startup.
			
			ex:   php.ini,  laragon.ini,  mysql.ini,  etc...
			
2.  .log => log file
			it will contain all the run time errors and exceptions occurred during execution of the program
			
				it stores the information with alerts status
				1. success
				2. info
				3. warning
				4. danger (critical)
				

Question:-  In live server displayerror are disabled being a developer how will you find the, errors for development environment.

Ans:-
error log

Note ::
What is scenerio in server environment
www.facebook.com (master)  : Live 10 lakhs traffic
test.facebook.com  (testing)    | PUSH
dev.facebook.com   (dev-1)   | PUSH


3.  .cnf or .conf => configuration file
			configurations file, it contains the configuration which are required during execution of the program at
			runtime execution


WWW => This menu will open and show all the projects you will create any c:/laragon/www
																			|p1.php
																			|array
																			|online examination
																				

		1. server document Root :- it contain the system path 
								c:/laragon/www
		
		what is the document root of Wamp?
			c:/wamp/www
		
		what is the document root of Xammp?
			c:/xammp/htdocs
			
		
		2. Explore Menu :- it is used to, open the existing project in explorer window.
		
		3. Share :- It is used to share the resources with your teammates connected to work.
		
		4. Project Launcher :- It will launch every project in URL
		

Quick App :-  In PHP every project is called as App.
			
			These Apps can be Classified as [Community-Name] App
			for ex:-
					1. Wordpress community :-  wordpress App
					2. laravel community  :-  laravel App
					3. Drupal community  :-  drupal App
					4. CodeIgnitor community  :-  CodeIgnitor App  or CI App
					...
					...
					etc..
					

			Using quick app we can Automatically, configure and Install Wordpress

What is Index.php?
index.php is the by default file of Apache which will be directly loaded in the URL.

Which server you are using?
Apache Server

Apache server is INSTALLED in which server?
Laragon

What is my current file name?
hello.php

Where this is stored?
inside c:/laragon/www inside laragon server

From where you want to access hello.php



Where index.php is stored?
inside c:/laragon/www
					|index.php
					

From where you can access this index.php
from browser (client)
make the request

URL(uniform resource locator)
URI(unifrom resource Identifier)

URL has following parts:-
************************
URL is a kind of web-address to some resource located at any server.
URL can be of two types:-
1. Protocol based
2. Non-Protocol based: uses IP Address




Difference between HTTP and HTTPS

							HTTP						HTTPS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------					
URL					|		https://			|		https://
Security			|		Unsecure			|		Enhanced Security
Port				|		PORT 80				|		PORT 443
OSI layer			|		Application Layer	|		Transport Layer
TLS Certificate		|		NO					|		YES
Doamin validation	|		Not Required		|		Domain validation (+legal validation)
Encryption			|		No					|		Yes


URL SYNTAX:-
[protocol-name]://<sub-domain>/<domain>/<host>/:<PORT>/<resource-url>

https://            protocol
test                sub-domain
seeksolution		domain-name
.in                 host
:<443>              port
web-address/login   resource-url
end-point

uri-segment:-  each part separated by / single slash, is called as uri-segment

after port :-  it is basically path to resource

after protocol and before endpoints (test.seeksolution.in:443) is called as domain name.
Every Domain may have a sub-domain or not but will have a port.
and every domain will have a IP Address, since one cannot learn or remember IP Address so, we provide a allias name
and this allias name is called as domain name and this domain name has to be registerd (mapped) with a IP Address in DNS.

Q.Identify protocol, port, uri-segment, domain-host, domain-name, sub-domain, resource, extension, mime type, ip address,
loop back address, local address, foreign address.

http://dev.localhost/myProject/admin/p1.php


protocol:  http://
port:  80
uri-segment: dev.localhost/myProject/admin/p1.php
domain-host: 
domain-name: dev.localhost
sub-domain: dev
resource: myProject/admin/p1.php
extension: .php
mime type: .php 
ip address: 127.0.0.1
loop back address: 127.0.0.1
local address: 127.0.0.1
foreign address: ::1


Q. What is mime type?
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)


Q. How browser Handles a file loaded in the browser?
ANS:- 1. Browser checks for the mime type supported by browser meta catalog (Dictionary)
	  2. If it exists, then it will be loaded in the memory. Else, it will be thrown as a download (this is reason why
	  browser does not) give any memory allocation to the non-supported file. And will be send to downloads.
	  
	  
	  This is because of the browser can support two types of files:-
	  a) Renderable :- 
	  b) Non Rendarable :- 
	  
1. mime type supported ---> Memory loaded
		a). renderable : the file which follows SGML standard or WHATWG standards.
		
		b). non-renderable : the file which do not follow SGML or WHATWG standard will be loaded as plain text (as raw file). In that case we need to add handlers to handle such type of file.
		
		
		How to Run Any php file in the browser
		----------------------------------------
		1. Add Handler php8 ---> Software ---> PHP Interpreter ---> Activate --->


2. mime type not supported ---> Downloaded not loaded into memory.
