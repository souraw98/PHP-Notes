URL SYNTAX:-
[protocol-name]://<sub-domain>/<domain>/<host>/:<PORT>/<resource-url>

https://            protocol
test                sub-domain
seeksolution		domain-name
.in                 host
:<443>              port
web-address/login   resource-url
end-point

uri-segment:-  each part separated by / single slash, is called as uri-segment

after port :-  it is basically path to resource

after protocol and before endpoints (test.seeksolution.in:443) is called as domain name.
Every Domain may have a sub-domain or not but will have a port.
and every domain will have a IP Address, since one cannot learn or remember IP Address so, we provide a allias name
and this allias name is called as domain name and this domain name has to be registerd (mapped) with a IP Address in DNS.

Q.Identify protocol, port, uri-segment, domain-host, domain-name, sub-domain, resource, extension, mime type, ip address,
loop back address, local address, foreign address.

domain-host: 
domain-name: dev.localhost
