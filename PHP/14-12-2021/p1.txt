Getting started with php
*************************
1. Goto your document Root
	c:/laragon/www
	
launch cmd or gitbash

2. create folder
	mkdir app-2021
	
3. goto inside app-2021 folder
	cd app-2021



3. How to create php file
	start notepad <file-name.php>
	for eg:
	start notepad p1.php
	start notepad p2.php
	start notepad p3.php
	start notepad p4.php

4. How to run th program:-
	php <filename.php>

5. there are two possible cases.
	case 1 : you will get a output
	case 2 : php niot recognised as internal or external command
	
	
	you have written the code of php ----> execute php interpreter
	php interpreter ----> laragon
	1. set the Environment variable set
	2. use the laragon terminal
	
How many ways we can run php programs:
1. using laragon terminal
	launch laragon terminal
	goto file
	type php filename.php  
	
	output : terminal ----> php cli mode
	
2. using cmd/git bash ....
	launh cmd/git bash
	goto file
	type 
		php filename.php
	
	output: terminal ---> php cli mode
	
3. using php inbuilt server
	cli server
	goto file 
	type
		php -S localhost:<port-no>
		
	goto browser
	make a request
	localhost:<port-no>
	type URL: filename.php
	
	url:
		localhost:<port-no>/file-name.php
		
	output : web ---> php cli web mode
	
note: in this case you need not to enable laragon server.

in php version 5.6.2 php supports inbuilt server
	
How to close the running server 
ctrl + c :- current executing command close	


4. Laragon (server) web-interface:-
	server : on
	php : apache : on
	mysql : on
	
	make the request using browser, for http://localhost:<apache-port>
	http://localhost:786
	
	or
	Quick Open using cmd
	window+R
	type cmd hit enter
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How any ways you can execute the PHP code
1. php cli mode
		a. laragon terminal
		b. git bash
		c. cmd/powershell
		
		d. php interactive mode ---> php REPL ---> php>

		How to launch php repl mode
		cmd:-
			type php -a
			php> without using opening and closing of php tags
			but ; is mandatory.
			
			wap in php interactive
			php > $x="ravi";
			php > echo $x;
			ravi
			
			Note: php -a and php -S, here -a and -S are called as command line argument.
			
			on suppliyng these arguments,  the program starts executing in the same given environment.
			
			How to see list of all arguments:-
			
			cmd: php -help
			
			php -a :- interactive mode
			php -r :- execute the code as readline
			php -v :- display the current version og php
			php --version : -display the current version 
			php -h :- run the helps
			php -m :- loads all the important modules initialised by php.ini
			
			
			wap in php to run a php code in readline
			**************************************
			we will use php -r command to run the code in readline
			
			cmd:> php -r "echo 'hello world';"
			hello world
			
			
	
2. php web mode	
		a. php cli server: php -S <url>:<any-port-no>
		b. using laragon web interface
		
		
We have only two types of program in a programming language
1. with input : Addition oftwo numbers with input.
2. without input : Hello world


How to create  our first input program in web-interface
*****************************************************************************88

Input fields : HTML FORMS

1. create a html form
2. Add any number of field you require
3. Add a submit button
4. Add form Tag, with Action, and method="GET" or method="POST"
5. Add the server-side page url which is going to handle the request at server-side.
6. Fill the form and Hit on submit button.
7. You will get, a Not Found 404 error. Because resource does not exist.
8. create a server-side page, which can handle client request and process data and give the response.
9. use the superglobal variable, of  php to accept the request using
	$_REQUEST to handle the form fields.
10. since, $_REQUEST is a, Array, it has a key as name field attribute in HTML form and use echo statement to display the output and after words comment it.
11. Nte that, add id and name attribute on html forms to handle each form controls on server side.
	Concept: This concept is valid for all language jsp, python, asp.net and php also
	id ---> for javascript or client side.
	name ---> for server side 
	
	
**************************************************************************************************

Task:
1. wap in php to accept name and display on another page
2. WAP in php to take 3 numbers as input and display sum
3. wap in php to make calculator to find sum, subtract, mul, div
4. wap in php take info of user name, email, password, mobile and display his info in next page
5. wap in php p,r,t and find S.I.
6. wap in php accept length, breadth from user and calculate area of rectangle and parameter
7. wap in php to take radius as input and find area, circumfrence of a circle
8. wap in php to find remainder of a given two numbers when a/b
9. wap in php to find remainder of a given two numbers when a/b without modulo operator
10. wap in php to take a and b as input and use -,/,* operator to find sum but you are not allowed to use + operator and condition
	1. a>b
	2. a>0
	3. b>0
11. wap in php to take input of 5 subject of student, Enter his marks and show the marks of each subject with overall %

using Client side validation on PHP
***********************************

Q. What is validation and types of validation?
Ans:- Validating or restricting the user from entering the invalid data in the form field is called as validation

Most common question:-
what is the difference between validation, authentication and authorisation

Client Side: Front End Language (HTML, CSS, CSS3, Less, SASS, VanillaJS(javascript), JQuery, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, SVG, Images, Fonts, Icons, Themes, Widgets, Layouts, Other framework of js (reactjs, angular, angularjs,backbonejs,emberjs,nextjs,redux,vuejs.....)) 

Server Side :- Backend Language including Database (c++, go, rust, c, php, python, ruby, R, nodejs, expressjs, JAVA(JSP,servelet,), asp.net, scala, perl....)

Database:- 
SQL Based Database (Structured database)
1. oracle
2. mysql
3. SQLite
4. Mariadb
5. MS SQL

Unstructured Database : No-SQL Database
1. MongoDB
2. Dynam0 DB
3. CouchDb
4. Candendra
5. Redis
6. PostgreSQL
7. Firebase
8. S3(Simple Storage Service) bucket (AWS)

Most common question:-
what is the difference between validation, authentication and authorisation

1. validation will prevent server from, providing invalid or uploading illegal files format in the database or server by the user.

for eg:- Enter The Name: 1234567890   invalid

Incase of validation there is no involvement of database.
validation : javascript : client side
validation : php : serverside
	1. both side :- because there may be chance that user amy have blocked his javascript or disabled the javascript.
	
	Interview:-
	Q1. Making email id unique for each registartion is example?
	ANS:- Athentication why?
			Because user email will be checked from database.
			
	Note:- In case of validation either from client side or server side only logic will be involved, not database.
	
	But checking the format of email is validation.
	abcd@gmail.com ----> format match ----> pattern ----> pattern matching or regular expression.
	
2. Authentication:-  Cross checking the identity of existing user from database is called as Authentication

	Such types of features is used in case of 
	Login, Email verification, unique email, forget password, google login, fb login, github login, linked in login.....
	opt verification, otp login
	
	Question:- captcah is which type of validation
	captcha:- completely automated public turing test to check computers and humans apart.
	
	It is always server side because it invloves session which is in server side ----> session data that is already encrypted.
	
3. Authorization:- It refers to permission, given to authenticated user.
				   Once the user is valid then it may have few permission or may not have any permission. this concept is authorization.
				   
				   for:-
						I can register in panel:- login in there (authenticated)
						----> loginned ----> i cannot see any course (authorised for any course)
						
					for eg:- trial user,    premium user
							|10 features	|20 features
							(non-authorised) (authorised)
							
			1. Types of  Authorization
				a. No Authorization (user ---> Role)
				b. Fully Authorization (Super Admin ---> Role)
				c. Partially Authorization (admin ---> Role)
				
			Roles & permission is kind of Authorization.
			
			
			eg:-
			School ERP:- (Enterprise Resource Planning)
			1. Teacher
					|Add Attendence
					|View Attendence
					
			2. Student
					|View Attendence
					
			Here student cannot add attendence because student is not authorised for adding attendence.
			
Working With PHP CLI:-
1. hello world : without input
2. Addition of two numbers: with input

Inn order to take input on console window or cli mode, we need a scanner.php file where we define input()function.


Postmortem of input() function inside scanner.php
(************************************************)
inn order to understand this, how input function works following concepts are required

1. use of echo statements
2. driver protocol  [protocol]://
3. concept of user-defined function
4. returning from a function
5. using default argument in a function
6. file-pointer and file handling
7. input output buffer or I/O streams
8. using trim() function.

Q.  Do  PHP support inbuilt, console input function?
ANS: yes, readline() is predefined function used to take input.


WAP inn php to perform addition of two numbers using readline mehthod in cli.
*******************************************************************************

php > $name = readline();                                                                                                                                                   
saurav                                                                                                                                                                      
php > echo $name;                                                                                                                                                           
saurav
php > $name = readline('Enter the Name');                                                                                                                                   
Enter the Name             saurav                                                                                                                                                        
php > echo $name;                                                                                                                                                           
saurav
php >                                                                                                                    
       
<?php

$a = readline('Enter First number: ');
$b=readline('Enter Second number: ');

$c=$a+$b;

echo "Sum is: ".$c;

?>


OUTPUT:-
Enter First number: 4
Enter Second number: 4
Sum is: 8                                            

Explanation of above concepts:-
************************************

1. use of echo statements
		we can echo statement for printing the string value, or any variable value or any constant literal.
		
		php > echo 'Hello World';
		Hello World
		php > echo "Hello World";
		Hello World
		php > echo 10;
		10
		php > echo $x=10;
		10
		php > echo true;
		1
		php > echo  false;
		
		
		php > echo [10,20,30];
		Array is string conversion error
		
		NOTE:: echo  will evaluate,  the expression as a string.
		
		lower conversion : int
		upper conversion : string
		
		php > echo [10,20,30];                                                                                                                                                      

		Notice: Array to string conversion in php shell code on line 1
		Array
		php > echo 'hy';                                                                                                                                                            
		hy
		php > echo join([10,20,30]);                                                                                                                                                
		102030
		php >   
		
		
		
		php > echo null; //constant literal
		
		php > echo null;
		php > echo json_encode(null);
		null
		php >   
		
		php > echo (null==false);
		1
		php > echo (null===false);
		php>  


			NOTE:: null==0==false==''==true==1
			
			=== we can find the difference
	
		
		
		Q1: $x=(false=='');
		a) 1  valid
		b) 0
		c)  
		d) None of the above
		
		Q1: $x=(false==='');
		a) 1  valid
		b) 0 
		c)    valid
		d) None of the above
